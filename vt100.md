We assume that:
- the user only pushes one button at a time, maybe with SHIFT or CTRL but not both. They release the button before pressing the next.

# VT100 Terminal Specification

The *state* of a VT100 terminal consists of the following:

* the *display contents*, an 80 x 24 array of characters, all initially ' '
* the *brightness level*, an integer from 0 to 15 with initial value of 8 (guesses)
* the *saved display contents*, an 80 x 24 array of characters, all initially ' '
* setUp : Enum(Off, A, B) --- indicates if the terminal is in SETUP mode, initially Off
* onLine mode : Enum(Online, Local) --- initially Online
* keyboardLocked : Boolean --- true iff the terminal is in keyboard locked mode, initially false
* L1 : Boolean --- true iff the L1 LED is lit, initially false
* L2 : Boolean --- true iff the L2 LED is lit, initially false
* L3 : Boolean --- true iff the L3 LED is lit, initially false
* L4 : Boolean --- true iff the L4 LED is lit, initially false
* VT52/ANSI mode : Enum(VT52, ANSI), initially ANSI
* Alternative keyboard mode : Boolean
* Auto repeat : Boolean
* Auto XON XOFF : Boolean
* Bits per character : Boolean
* Characters per line : Boolean
* Cursor : Boolean
* Cursor key mode : Boolean
* Interlace : Boolean
* New line : Boolean
* Keyclick : Boolean
* Margin bell : Boolean
* Origin mode : Boolean
* Parity : Boolean
* Parity sense : Boolean
* Power : Boolean
* Receive speed : Boolean
* Screen : Boolean
* Scroll : Boolean
* Tabs : Boolean
* Transmit speed : Boolean
* Wraparound : Boolean
* \# Â£ 3 : Boolean
* caps lock : Boolean
* The *answerback message* : String

-- local == ! onLine?
-- Entering and exiting setup clears keyboardLocked
